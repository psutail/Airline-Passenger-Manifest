# Airline-Passenger-Manifest
Travelling abroad is one of the best treats you can give yourself. But before you can fly out, you will have to go
through the check-in and boarding process which sometimes takes more than an hour to do. And this would take even
longer especially on peak seasons and if the system is unable to handle the volume of traffic.
To address these issues and to achieve the best customer experience, a newly built airport is looking for Software
Engineers to revamp a 60-year-old system from scratch. The new system design is expected to be modern, webbased, extensible, future proof and more robust than the old system which was built using FOXPRO.
